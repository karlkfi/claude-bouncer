## Queue

Specific actionable items in priority order. Pick from the top; skip 🚫 items until their blocker clears.

| ID | Item | Labels | St | Sz | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="Q60"></a>Q60 | Catch a pattern-fed kill whose filter isn't grep | `security` | 🔲 | M | `ps \| awk '/pat/ {print $1}' \| xargs kill` collects no pattern and defers; so does a kill wrapped in `sh -c '…'`. Reading an awk program as a pattern would deny every anchored pipeline, so this needs real pid provenance. See [plan](plan/pattern-fed-kill-deny.md). |

## Deferred

| ID | Item | Labels | Sz | Trigger to revive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <a id="Q23"></a>Q23 | Opt-in extra-roots for shared cross-worktree files | `security` | M | **Demand:** a session that legitimately needs cross-worktree shared files (mailbox files, the main checkout) and can't tolerate the prompts. Fix: an opt-in, empty-by-default extra-roots env var. |
| <a id="Q42"></a>Q42 | Catch a glob match that is itself a symlink out of the root | `security` | M | **Demand:** a glob-matched in-root name that points outside gets read silently. A glob resolves as the pattern, so `realpath` never sees the match. Closing it needs match enumeration. |
| <a id="Q47"></a>Q47 | Catch a `**` glob item that matches fewer segments than the pattern | `security` | M | **Demand:** a session runs `shopt -s globstar`. Verified: `docs/**` expands to `docs/` too, so a loop body's trailing `../` climbs above the root undetected. Issue 99's proxy needs fixed segments. |
| <a id="Q53"></a>Q53 | Grow the PowerShell coverage past the cmdlet table | `security` | M | **Demand:** a real outside read slips through. A .NET call, a native `.exe`, or an unlisted cmdlet is unchecked and silent; prompting on the unparsed tail was rejected as too noisy. See [Q51's known gaps](plan/q51-powershell-tool.md). |
| <a id="Q54"></a>Q54 | Quiet `$_` in a PowerShell `ForEach-Object` block | `parsing` | S | **Demand:** the friction report shows `$_` prompts accumulating. It reports as 'expand' like bash's `cat $f`, but carries far more of PowerShell's idiom. See [Q51's known gaps](plan/q51-powershell-tool.md). |
